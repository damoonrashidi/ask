# Ask

Ask tries to understand what shell you're using and then fetches a shell command based on your natural language input using ChatGPT.

## Installation

Currently the only way to install is via git using Rust. I'm going to add this to homebrew in a bit.

````bash
git clone https://github.com/damoonrashidi/ask
cd ./ask
cargo install --path .
```
