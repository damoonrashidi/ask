# Ask

Ask tries to understand what shell you're using and then fetches a shell command based on your natural language input using ChatGPT.

## Example

```bash
~/‚ùØ ask list all branches and their authors
git for-each-ref --format='%(authorname) %09 %(refname:short)' refs/heads/
```

## Features (Implemented or Planned)

- [x] Ask for a command using natural language
- [x] Per shell history to avoid spamming OpenAI requests. Works well with reverse history.
- [x] Press enter to execute command. `q`/`ESC` to abort.
- [ ] Editing the command before executing when pressing `e`.
- [ ] Copy command to clipboard when pressing `c`.
- [ ] Add command to shell history after executing.
- [ ] Add config file to enable/disable command caching, overriding shell detection etc.

## Shells that can be recognized
- [x] bash
- [x] zsh
- [x] nushell
- [ ] Fish
- [ ] Powershell

## Installation

Ensure that an `OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable is available in your shell. API keys can be found in your [api key settings](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

```bash
export OPENAI_APIKEY="sk-...xxxx"
```
