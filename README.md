# Ask

Ask tries to understand what shell you're using and then fetches a shell command based on your natural language input using ChatGPT.

## Example

```bash
~/‚ùØ ask list all branches and their authors
git for-each-ref --format='%(authorname) %09 %(refname:short)' refs/heads/
```

## Features (Implemented or Planned)

- [x] Ask for a command using natural language
- [x] Per shell history to avoid spamming OpenAI requests. Works well with reverse history.
- [ ] Planned: Press enter to execute command. `q`/`ESC` to abort.
